This is a folder for the proto-generated files. It mirrors the folder structure
of the root proto folder in the git repo. It's required for Python import.

The files in this folder are git ignored (except for this `README.md`). Run
`${git_root}/roadpy/shortcut/compile_proto.sh` to generate files in this folder.
